# You can put files here to add functionality separated per file, which

# Files on the custom/ directory will be automatically loaded by the init

# For example: add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on.

# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr

# cd into whatever is the forefront Finder window.
cdf() {  # short for cdfinder
  cd "`osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)'`"
